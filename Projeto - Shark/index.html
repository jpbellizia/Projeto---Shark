            <p>Sharks are fascinating creatures that have inhabited Earth's oceans for more than 400 million years. They
                have a reputation as ruthless predators, but the reality is much more complex. With more than 500
                different species, sharks play a vital role in marine ecosystems and are essential to the health of the
                oceans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Sharks, often feared and misunderstood, are fundamental to the balance, health and biodiversity of marine
                fauna. Through conservation and responsible management, we can ensure that these magnificent predators
                continue to play their crucial role in the oceans for generations to come.

            <p>Sharks, often portrayed as ruthless predators, play a fundamental and complex role in marine fauna,
                acting as top predators, regulating populations, ensuring the health of ecosystems and promoting
                biodiversity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top Predators</strong>: Sharks hunt diverse species, from fish and crustaceans to marine
                    mammals. This predation controls the populations of their prey, preventing overpopulation and
                    resource depletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Balance</strong>: By controlling prey populations, sharks ensure that food
                    resources are distributed evenly among different species, preventing overexploitation and habitat
                    degradation.</li>
                <li><strong>Trophic Cascade</strong>: Predation by sharks generates a cascade effect throughout the food
                    chain, influencing the health of several species, from plankton to large cetaceans.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Horror films featuring sharks can have a negative impact on public perception of these   animals,
                perpetuating myths and hindering conservation efforts. Through conscious consumption of content, support
                for protection and education organizations, we can deconstruct these stereotypes and build a fairer and
                more harmonious relationship with sharks, recognizing their crucial role in the oceans and their need
                for protection.

                    <p>
                        Films often portray sharks as ruthless predators and serial killers, ignoring the complex reality of their behavior and the ecological importance they play

                        Exaggerated scenes of shark attacks, often based on rare and exceptional
                        cases, fuel fear and misinformation, ignoring the peaceful nature of most species.

                    <p>
                        Films rarely provide context about the importance of sharks to marine ecosystems, their
                        vulnerability to overfishing and other threats, perpetuating the simplistic view that they are dangerous
                        and undesirable.
